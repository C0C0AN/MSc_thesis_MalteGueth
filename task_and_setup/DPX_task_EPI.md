Dot Pattern Expectancy Task
Each block consisted of 52 trials with four different trialtypes (AX, BX, AY, BY). Blocks were separated by one minute breaks 
and preceded by 18 practice trials. One trial consisted of two stimulus types. Stimuli consisted of dot patterns highlighted 
within a square of nine equidistant, blue dots. The first dot pattern (i.e. the cue) was presented in light blue for 100 ms 
on a white background, followed by a jittered interstimulus interval of 3 to 5 seconds. The second dot pattern (i.e. the probe)
was presented in grey. As soon as the probe appeared, subjects had a time window of 800 ms to respond. After 300 ms the probe 
disappeared. A jittered intertrialinterval of 2.5 to 4.5 seconds separated the probe from the next cue (min. duration: 6.4 s; 
max. duration: 10.4).
Subjects were instructed to respond with a right button push after a correct cue-probe combination and with a left button push 
after an incorrect combination. In the correct combination (AX) there was a vertical line of three blue dots on top of one 
another as a cue. The corresponding probe had the two upper dots of the vertical line and one on the right in the middle in 
white. Any deviation in the cue, probe or in both was considered incorrect. All patterns were constructed starting with of 
nine equidistant dots arranged in a square.
Across the four blocks 208 trials were presented with 136 AX (65%) and 24 trials (11.6%) for BX, AY and BY respectively. 
However, due to an error in the programming (see ‘Stimulist.pcl’) the fourth block consisted of 33 AX and 7 BX trials. 
Therefore, the actual amount is 135 AX, 25 BX and 24 AY and BY trials.

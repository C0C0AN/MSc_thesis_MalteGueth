1st week
- I uploaded the second part of the basic eeg preprocessing in MNE python up to averaging epochs
- I uploaded my first draft for forward modeling of EEG data informed by structural MRI data and annotations on how to compute the BEM surfaces, the transformation fif file from coregestering the structural data with the eeg sensors and their common source space

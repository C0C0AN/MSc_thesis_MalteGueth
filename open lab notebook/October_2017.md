1st week: 
- I re-evaluated my preprocessing of EEG and fMRI data in FSL, Matlab and EEGLAB, specifically the EEG data and the identification of the QRS complex in the ECG
- Together with my supervisor, Peer Herholz, I discussed how to transfer my data and analyses from Matlab to an entirely open science based platform (i.e. MNE-python, Nipype, etc.)

2nd week:
- 

3rd week:
- ___Start of official documentation and updating of my progress on GitHub___
- I continued studying EEG preprocessing in MNE-python and searched for analysis scripts, forum discussions or tutorials aimed at cleaning artifacts from combined EEG-fMRI recordings (i.e. gradient artifacts, cardioballistic artifacts)
- A preliminary attempt at a scripted EEG preprocessing till ICA for EEG data from combined recordings was uploaded (see preprocessing folder)
- I discussed the intermediate status of my thesis with Peer Herholz and Jens Sommer and started making plans for further steps in finishing my thesis and publishing it afterwards
- I started converting an approach in MNE meant to detect ICA components that are related to eye blinks and saccades in the EOG to identifying components correlated to the QRS complex in the ECG for a more grounded reasoning on which components to exclude
- While writing the preprocessing script, I started working on a rough sketch for an illustrated guide on how to preprocess (combined) EEG data for students/researchers who are unfamiliar with EEG
- MNE documentation: https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html

4th week: 
- I continued studying EEG preprocessing in MNE-python
- I visited a conference in Rauischholzhausen where EEG, fNIRS as well as combined fNIRS and fMRI recordings were discussed to present my preliminary results on the DPX task in EEG, EEG-fNIRS and EEG-fMRI

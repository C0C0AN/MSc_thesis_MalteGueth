3rd week: 
- I continued studying EEG preprocessing in MNE-python and searched for analysis scripts, forum discussions or tutorials aimed at cleaning artifacts from combined EEG-fMRI recordings (i.e. gradient artifacts, cardiballistic artifacts)
- A preliminary attempt at a scripted EEG preprocessing till ICA for EEG data from combined recordings was uploaded (see preprocessing folder)
- I discussed the intermediate status of my thesis with Peer and Jens and started making plans for 
- I started converting an approach in MNE meant to detect ICA components that are related to eye blinks and saccades in the EOG to identifying components correlated to the QRS complex in the ECG for a more grounded reasoning on which components to exclude
- While writing the preprocessing script, I started working on a rough sketch for an illustrated guide on how to preprocess (combined) EEG data for students/researchers who are unfamiliar with EEG

4th week: 
- I continued studying EEG preprocessing in MNE-python
- I visited a conference in Rauischholzhausen where EEG, fNIRS as well as combined fNIRS and fMRI recordings were discussed to present my preliminary results on the DPX task in EEG, EEG-fNIRS and EEG-fMRI

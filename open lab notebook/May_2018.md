1st week
- I tried to focues on writing and graphics design, but encountered several distractions prolonging the process.
- I finalized time series correlations and on Friday discussed different versions of N-PLS with Jos√©. We picked a reduced model,
risiking that limited results that only encompass ROIs could end up the same as the input, threreby just re-affirming the ROIs 
to be most relevant regions. Still, in regards to the research question, as to how alpha and theta signatures load on different.
voxel in the PFC and parietal cortex, we decided to focus on these regions and, thus, limit interpretations.

2nd week
- All graphics were finished by Wednesday morning and all texts by Wednesday evening. I added supplementary data results as 
appendices or uploaded them. For some results I still need to refine codes and annotations, so others in my lab who are
planning to use EEG-fMRI can re-use them.
_ I ran into a few formating issues when in exported the Word file to PDF, which kept me busy until Thursday
- On Thursday, I resolved most of the formating issues and send my final draft of the master thesis to all my instructors and teachers. The PDF and Word file are now uploaded.
- Friday, I printed the thesis and handed it in.

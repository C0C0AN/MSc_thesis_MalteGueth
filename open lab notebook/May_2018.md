1st week
- I tried to focues on writing and graphics design, but encountered several distractions prolonging the process
- I finalized time series correlations and on Friday discussed different versions of N-PLS with Jos√©. We picked a reduced model,
risiking that limited results that only encompass ROIs could end up the same as the input, threreby just re-affirming the ROIs 
to be most relevant regions. Still, in regards to the research question, as to how alpha and theta signatures load on different
voxel in the PFC and parietal cortex, we decided to focus on these regions and, thus, limit interpretations

2nd week
- On Thursday, I send my final draft of the master thesis to all my instructors and teachers. The PDF and Word file are now
uploaded
- Friday, I printed the thesis and handed it in.

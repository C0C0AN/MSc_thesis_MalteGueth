1st week:
- I studied ways to combine different electric stimulation techniques (i.e. tDCS, tACS and deep brain stimulation) with MRI
- I added some basic “single-method” results (behavioural, electrophysiological, hemodynamic) plots and codes plotting

2nd week:
- I added poster I presented this year at the Meeting of the German Neuroscience Society (GNS_2017.pdf), Psychology and brain (PUG_2017.pdf) and the foundation symposium of the Marburg Center for mind, brain and behavior (MCMBB_2017.pdf)
- I tried the "Radon" example on multilevel modeling using PyStan (http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/radon.html) and PyMC3 (http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/bayesian-glms-3/)


3rd week:
- I want to continue writing on my behavioural prediction script
- I want to add new text excerpts to my methods and introduction sections

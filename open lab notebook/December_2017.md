1st week:
- I studied ways to combine different electric stimulation techniques (i.e. tDCS, tACS and deep brain stimulation) with MRI
- I added some basic “single-method” results (behavioural, electrophysiological, hemodynamic) plots and codes plotting

2nd week:
- I want to continue writing on my behavioural prediction script and upload a first draft
- I want to add new text excerpts to my methods and introduction sections

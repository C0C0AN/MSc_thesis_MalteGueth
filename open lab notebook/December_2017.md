1st week:
- I studied ways to combine different electric stimulation techniques (i.e. tDCS, tACS and deep brain stimulation) with MRI
- I added some basic “single-method” results (behavioural, electrophysiological, hemodynamic) plots and codes plotting

2nd week:
- I added posters I presented this year at the Meeting of the German Neuroscience Society in Goettingen (GNS_2017.pdf), Psychology and brain in Trier (PUG_2017.pdf) and the foundation symposium of the Marburg Center for mind, brain and behavior (MCMBB_2017.pdf)
- I tried the "Radon" example on multilevel modeling using PyStan (http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/radon.html) and PyMC3 (http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/bayesian-glms-3/)

3rd week:
- I studied further literature on simultaneous EEG and fMRI as well as cognitive control for my introduction section
- I downloaded literature into my Mendeley library and organised it

4th week:

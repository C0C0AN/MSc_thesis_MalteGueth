1st week
- In preparation for finalising my master thesis, I'm planning to submit my introduction and methods section to my
supervisors for a frist feedback round
- Due to exam and interview preparations, I changed plans and instead of focusing on text production, I shifted to code optimization
- I uploaded further excerpts and notes for hierarchical modeling and multiway partial least squares regression for EEG-fMRI

2nd week
- This week I prepared for my exams and continued writing code for multimodal analyses (i.e. multilevel modeling, pls)
- After finfishing an important exam, I found time to improve the overall outline, literature foundation and structure 
for my thesis and handed in my introduction section to my supervisors for provisional feedback

3rd week
- In the next days I want to finish my methods section and upload more code to my repo

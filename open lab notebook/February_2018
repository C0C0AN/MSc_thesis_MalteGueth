1st week
- In preparation for finalising my master thesis, I'm planning to submit my introduction and methods section to my
supervisors for a frist feedback round
- Due to exam and interview preparations, I changed plans and instead of focusing on text production, I shifted to code optimization
- I uploaded further excerpts and notes for hierarchical modeling and multiway partial least squares regression for EEG-fMRI

2nd week
- This week I want to prepare for my exams, continue writing code for multimodal analyses (i.e. hierarchical modeling, pls)
and hand in at least my introduction section

1st week
- In preparation for finalizing my master thesis, I'm planning to submit my introduction and methods section to my
supervisors for a frist feedback round
- Due to exam and interview preparations, I changed plans and instead of focusing on text production, I shifted to code optimization
- I uploaded further excerpts and notes for hierarchical modeling and multiway partial least squares regression for EEG-fMRI

2nd week
- This week I prepared for my exams and continued writing code for multimodal analyses (i.e. multilevel modeling, pls)
- After finfishing an important exam, I found time to improve the overall outline, literature foundation and structure 
for my thesis and handed in my introduction section to my supervisors for provisional feedback

3rd week
- I added further excerpts to my methods section, but could not finish it yet
- After sending my provisional introduction section to my supervisors, I received some feeback, integrated 
my superviors' suggestions and corrected mistakes they pointed out to me
- I uploaded some code snippets for building my multilevel model for predicting behavioral data with unimodal and
multimodal predictors, using lme4 in R instead of pystan or pymc3

4th week
- Since I had trouble with my publisher with my recent book manuscript, I had to delay writing my methods section
- While writing my methods, I noticed that it was not as straightforward as expected to choose the appropriate section 
for details on best practices for EEG and MRI preparations which do not exclusively relate to simultaneous experiments
- To figure out a sensible structure, I researched in an thesis previously writtn at the Department of Psychology 
involving an EEG-fMRI experiment
- I uploaded text excerpts on the sample, the general procedure and the paradigm of my experiment

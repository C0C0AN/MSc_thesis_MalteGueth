1st week
- Concerning the issue on structuring of the experimental protocol on best practices from last week, I presumably found a sensible 
solution of how to distribute the details in the methods section and uploaded a draft in my updated methods excerpts
- In addition to the methods, I uploaded some updated python scripts for statistical analyses of bahvioral data
- I had started coding these scripts in January and earlier, but never uploaded them and while checking on them I noticed
they were cumbersome, so I decided to spend some time truncating and expanding their usability
- Corresponding to the codes, I uploaded some plots for behavioral and self-report data

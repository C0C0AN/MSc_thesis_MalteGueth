1st week
- Concerning the issue on structuring of the experimental protocol on best practices from last week, I presumably found a sensible 
solution of how to distribute the details in the methods section and uploaded a draft in my updated methods excerpts
- In addition to the methods, I uploaded some updated python scripts for statistical analyses of bahvioral data
- I had started coding these scripts in January and earlier, but never uploaded them and while checking on them I noticed
they were cumbersome, so I decided to spend some time truncating and expanding their usability
- Corresponding to the codes, I uploaded some plots for behavioral and self-report data

2nd week
- Most of last week I spend studying for my final clinical exam in my master's program
- Still, I uploaded some R code on behavioral data analysis. The scripts I uploaded basically perform identical purposes as
the ones in python. However, having them in multiple languages eases many tasks further down the line and increases flexibility
- Lastly, I updated my thesis paper

3rd week
- In reporting how to adequately remove ballistocardiac artefacts in combined EEG-fMRI I had doubts whether I could reasonably justify that my data had been sufficiently cleaned. I was convinced of my method, but researched more on how other researchers reported objective criteria (this is a problem, since for EEG there is less indicators of signal quality than for fMRI).
- After doing more research and re-writing my entire pre-processing section, I did not change my approach, but think I reported in a convincing way and found appropriate sources
- I created new plots to illustrate my artefact score approach for rejecting ballistocardiac artefacts, refined the code and uploaded it
- Again, I updated my thesis paper

4th week
- To finish up all reports on behavioral data (reaction times, error rates, total error counts and corresponding proactive behavioral shift index) I completed all basic and advanced (linear mixed model effects regression) analyses and uploaded the necessary R code
- The code scripts included pre-processed data frames ready for different analyses, descriptives plots for the master thesis paper, basic inferential tests (i.e., ANOVA) and model equations for LMM regression
- I finished the results section on the behavioral part and added more basic parts of electrophysiological and neuroimaging data
- Based on the results reported, I added more text to my discussion (summary of basic results and conclusions drawn)
- To prepare for preregistration, I collected possible journals for future publication
- For better overview, I re-structured parts of my GitHub repo (e.g., new folder purely for experiment description and setup information

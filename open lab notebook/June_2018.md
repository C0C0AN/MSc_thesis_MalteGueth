3rd week
- After a long pause of not having written much into my master's repo, I made some updates on the code long overdue. 
These mostly focused on the EEG repo, since this one might be used soon by other students.
- Most changes addressed clarity of instructions, usability of the code and general trouble shooting not yet
pushed to the repo.
- For more progress on the paper meant to come from this thesis, I had a talk with my instructor which aspects of
this repo, the descriptions in my thesis and also analyses need revision (recording, scope of analyses, comprehensibility
of multimodal data fusion and further research into N-PLS).
- However, due to my departure from Germany coming soon and another paper with higher priority still pending, these 
revisions will take more time.

4th week
- As last week, I kept working on updating my repo for my thesis, cleaning code and making everything a little more
comprehensible. I might have pushed a little carelessly during a couple of months, so there is more work to do on
general transparency and annotation of the repo.
- Next to my master's repo I expanded my MPP for EEG repo and added a script for electrodermal activity and respiratory channels.
- Revisions are still on hold.

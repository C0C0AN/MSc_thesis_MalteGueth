1st week: 
- I continued studying EEG preprocessing in MNE-python
- I visited a conference in Rauischholzhausen where EEG, fNIRS as well as combined fNIRS and fMRI recordings were discussed to present my preliminary results on the DPX task in EEG, EEG-fNIRS and EEG-fMRI

2nd week:
- I wrote a first draft concerning the structure of my thesis and worked out an idea for a talk on open source EEG and fMRI analysis at the department o psychology

3rd week:
-	I want to update my literature on simultaneous recordings, test the amica algorithm for ICA in MNE, upload some text samples of my theoretical background for the paper and work on the correction approach that correlates ICA components with the QRS complex in the ECG

1st week:
- I wrote a first draft concerning the structure of my thesis and worked out an idea for a talk on open source EEG and fMRI analysis at the department o psychology

2nd week:
-	I tried to test the amica algorithm for ICA in MNE on a single subject, which was not yet integrated as a standard algorithm. Yet, it is available as a prototype that is executable with a few more lines of code
- I uploaded some text samples of my theoretical background for the paper
- I worked on the correction approach that correlates ICA components with likely artifacts in the ECG in MNE, uploaded my preliminary solution to my preprocessing folder and added it to the preprocessing script

3rd week:
- I added text excerpts to my methods section
- I studied how to write nipype pipelines for parallel preprocessing of EEG and fMRI data (https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/)
- I started writing on a script for an idea for hierarchical linear modeling to predict variation in behavioural, cognitive (i.e. digit-symbol coding test) or self-report data with EEG- and fMRI-derived predictors
- I improved the ECG-based correlational correction approach for ICA in MNE by building a template from a representative ECG artifact as in the PCA-based qrs template approach from many toolboxes in MATLAB (e.g. fMRIb plugin for MATLAB)

4th week:
- I want to add further text excerpts to my introduction and methods section
- I want to start writing nipype pipelines for parallel preprocessing of EEG and fMRI data
- I want to continue writing on a script for an idea for hierarchical linear modeling to predict variation in behavioural, cognitive (i.e. digit-symbol coding test) or self-report data with EEG- and fMRI-derived predictors
- I want to study how to write jupyter notebooks for open use of my scripts
